# textual-astview ChangeLog

## v0.2.0

**Released 2022-12-21**

### Added

- Added a `--theme` parameter to `astare` to set the theme for the source
  display.
- Added a `--themes` parameter to `astare` to list the themes available for
  the source display.
- Tweaked the current-AST-node highlight in the source code so that it's a
  bit less eye-achingly horrible. It's still not brilliant, but it's less
  bad. Suggestions welcome.

## v0.1.0

**Released 2022-12-20**
